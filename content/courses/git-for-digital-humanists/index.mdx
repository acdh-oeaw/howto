As knowledge workers, we constantly create and edit content, change a document, save it, change it again, share it with colleagues, etc.


**Git** is a free and open-source distributed “version control” software, which can help that process by

- tracking changes, and versioning content and code,

- supporting collaborative work by automatically comparing (“diffing”) and combining (“merging”) two or more versions of the same file, and

- clear attribution, making transparent which part of a file has been changed by whom and when (“blame”).

Git works best when used with plaintext file formats such as source code, XML/TEI documents or Markdown content. While Git will happily _store_ images, audio files, or `.doc` and `.pdf` documents, it is not able to provide its full diffing/merging capacities with them.

<SideNote type="info" title="A distributed version control software?">
Most of us will have encountered, and used, _some_ kind of version control: either some custom file naming convention to mark versions of a document, change tracking functionality built into word processors, or the history view of document edits on Wikipedia.

**Git** can record which changes, to which documents, have been made when, and by whom. It allows to **keep a detailed revision history of a project**, because it **can save snapshots of a project at specific points in time**, thus being open to review any time in the future.

**Version control** allows to save versions of content, restore previous versions, and compare different versions. This is especially beneficial when working with multiple documents, and when working in teams of more than one (potentially working on the same document).

In **Git** everybody always works on a local copy of a project, and Git helps to keep local project copies in sync. This is why Git is sometimes called a distributed version control system.
