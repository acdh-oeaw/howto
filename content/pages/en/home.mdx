title: Share and expand your knowledge in Digital Humanities
---

Welcome to ACDH-CH Learning Resources. This website gathers interactive learning material, practical
HowTo articles and best practices on a wide range of Digital Humanities topics, methododologies and
infrastructures.

These resources can be used for self-guided learning as well as for teaching in higher education. It
is part of our mission to actively transfer knowledge from ongoing research into the wider Digital
Humanities Community as well as to educate a new generation of humanities researchers with digital
methods.

The platform is being developed in the context of the [DITAH](https://www.ditah.at/) project, funded
by the Austrian Bundesministerium f√ºr Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung.
