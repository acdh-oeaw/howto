subtitle: A platform for sharing and expanding your knowledge of digital research tools and methods

Welcome to ACDH-CH Learning Resources. This living space gathers interactive learning material, practical HowTo articles and best practices on a wide range of Digital Humanities topics, methododologies and infrastructures.

These resources can be used for self-guided learning as well as for teaching in higher education. It is part of our mission to actively transfer knowledge from ongoing research into the wider Digital Humanities Community as well as to educate a new generation of humanities researchers with digital methods.

The platform is being developed in the context of the [DITAH](https://www.ditah.at/) project, funded by the Austrian Bundesministerium f√ºr Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft.
