## Introduction

Figma is a tool for collaborative UI design. It can be used both for interface mock-up (realistic visual design) and prototyping (realistic visual design plus simulation of interface functionalitites). Please note that mock-up and prototyping will usually not be the first steps in UI design: other steps in the requirement analysis (such as expert interviews, brainstorming, or use case modeling) will commonly pave the way for creating specific designs. Most especially, mock-up and prototyping are typically immediately preceded by pen-and-paper [wireframing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe).

From the digital humanist's perspective, key advantages of using Figma include its potential for creating visually realistic interface designs that can give the members of a DH project a precise idea of the UI to be developed. That can help to make a project team's decision-making in relation to web design more efficient. Furthermore, Figma allows to collaboratively design UIs without requiring any coding skills, thereby empowering project members who have little or no prior knowledge of web development.

This chapter will introduce you to Figma by offering a step-by-step guideline for creating a UI for an example project (a fictional digital edition titled "Awesome Poetry"). After completing the tutorial, you will be able to use the most common functions of Figma and know how to start designing your own project's interface. We recommend signing up for Figma and trying out the individual steps while working through these guidelines.

## First Steps

### Sign Up

Figma can be used through a [web-based application](https://www.figma.com/). There are different pricing options including a free `Starter` plan with limited numbers of files, as well as `Professional` (free for students and educators) and `Organization` plans (April 2022).

### Create a Team

Create a team to collaborate. Right at the start, Figma will ask you to name your team and invite your collaborators. Choose the `Starter` team plan for trying Figma. You can work in Figma individually as well. If you skip creating a team for now, you can later select `+ Create new team` in the bottom-left part of the Figma start screen.

In our example project, the team's name is "Awesome Poetry" (next to the blue square on the left).

## Mock-Up

### Create a Design File

To design a mock-up for our example project, create a new design file by clicking `New design file` (or by clicking the `+` icon that will appear next to `Team project` when you hover over it and selecting `Design file`). That will open the Figma workspace screen.

<Figure src="images/howto_figma_02.png" alt="Workspace">
Figure 2: The Figma workspace screen.
</Figure>

Take a moment to orient yourself. There is a dark gray tool bar in the top of the screen with several icons on the left and the file name in the middle (still "Untitled"); a `Layers` area on the left-hand side (still empty) will list the elements used in your mock-up/prototype; a `Design` area on the right-hand side will show you options to design those elements; the main window (gray) is where you will create the mock-up/prototye. Click on the file name and rename the file "ap_mockup".

The first step is to create a frame to represent the start page of your future website. When you click on the `Frame` icon (the third icon from left in the tool bar, the default choice of the `Region tools` dropdown list), the right-hand `Design` area will offer predefined sizes of frames that correspond to different devices for accessing websites. For our digital edition of awesome poetry, select `Desktop` size (1440 x 1024 px). In the left-hand `Layers` area, double-click the name of the frame ("Desktop - 1" or so) and rename it "StartPage".

<SideNote type="tip" title="Tip:">
**It is always good to give telling names to your objects in order not to get confused - there will soon be a lot of them!**
</SideNote>

### Create Sub-Frames

We can now add sub-frames within the "StartPage" top-frame to define large areas within that page. Let's first create a navigation bar: select `Frame` and draw an oblong shape in the top part of your page. In the `Layers` area, rename it "NavBar". The width and height are displayed in the right-hand `Design` area (and next to the frame when selected). Further below, in the `Fill` segment of the `Design` area, you can pick a color. In the example, a dark blue has been chosen. As that hue will be used as one of the edition UI's signature colors, it can be saved: next to `Fill`, click on the four-dot icon which the tooltip will identify as `Styles` button. Then, select `+` and name the color style, say, "EditionBlue". Now, you can easily come back to that color whenever you need it.

<Figure src="images/howto_figma_03.png" alt="Navigation bar">
Figure 3: Adding a navigation bar to your start page.
</Figure>

Add three more sub-frames: a large frame below the "NavBar" as the "MainFrame"; a smaller "FunderFrame" below that; and, finally, a slim "ImprintFrame" on the bottom of your "StartPage". Fill the "MainFrame" with an off-white color and save that color as "EditionWhite". Give the "FunderFrame" a thin blue border: in the `Stroke` segment of the `Design` area, click the four-dot icon and select the "EditionBlue" hue to apply the color style that has been saved before; set the line width to "1". Leave the "FunderFrame" white and make the "ImprintFrame" gray. In the left-hand `Layers` navigation, arrange the frames according to their position on the page.

### Populate Frames with Objects

<Figure src="images/howto_figma_04.png" alt="Tool bar">
Figure 4: The tool bar of the Figma workspace screen.
</Figure>

You can now start adding objects to the frames. In the `Shape tools` dropdown list (the fourth drop-down button from left in the tool bar of the workspace screen, highlighted here in orange), pick `Ellipse` and, in the blue "NavBar" of your page, draw a circle as a logo placeholder. Color it in "EditionWhite" and rename it "APLogoShape". Add some text onto it (such as "AP") by selecting the `Text` icon (the sixth button from left, highlighed here in green). You can style that text via the `Text` section of the `Design` area: again, select the "EditionBlue" hue by clicking the four-dot icon next to `Fill`. Rename the text object "APLogoText".

Furthermore, add a rectangular shape as well as some text to represent a drop-down button in the "NavBar". Style and rename as "DropDownShape" and "DropDownText", respectively.

Add three text objects to your "MainFrame": a title, a subtitle, and some placeholder text, representing an introduction to your edition website. Also, add a rectangle and a text to stand for a search field. In the "FunderFrame", add a shape and text to represent some funder's logo. Moreover, add a text, representing a link, to your "ImprintFrame". Style those objects and rename them in useful ways.

<SideNote type="tip" title="Tip:">
If one object gets hidden behind another (and is no longer visible), rearrange their order in the left-hand `Layers` area. When you place elements in a high position in the `Layers` area, they are displayed on top of other elements in the page design in the central window of the workspace screen.
</SideNote>

</Figure>

### Group Objects Together

It is useful to group together objects that belong together: for example, objects which constitute a more complex single object. In the `Layers` area, select both "APLogoText" and "APLogoShape", right-click them (or perform whatever action, on your device, corresponds to pressing the right-hand button on a mouse), and select `Group selection`. Groups are symbolized in the `Layers`area through dashed-line rectangles: rename the so created group "APLogo". Likewise, create "DropDown", "StartPageText", "SearchFunction", and "Logo" groups. When you select those group names in the `Layers` area, you can target the whole complex objects (instead of just their parts). In order to overview the elements of your page, you might wish to collapse those layers in the `Layers` area which are below the group level.

<Figure src="images/howto_figma_06.png" alt="Objects">
Figure 6: Objects in your start page being grouped together.
</Figure>

### Create Components

If there are objects or groups that are used more than once, you can create components out of them for easy reuse. In the `Layers` area, right-click the "Logo" group (the placeholder funder logo) and select `Create component`. You can also click the `Create component` icon in the middle of the tool bar of the workspace screen. As a component, it is now highlighted in purple color.

Now, change the view in the left-hand window from `Layers` to `Assets` by clicking the `Assets` tab. In that tab, you will find the "Logo" component below the "StartPage" segment. From here, you can drag-and-drop that component multiple times onto the "FunderFrame" to represent several funder logos.

<SideNote type="info" title="Note:">
It is important to note that if you change the original component (designated by a four-diamond icon in the `Layers` tab), all its instances (single-diamond icon) will be changed in like fashion (which is one of the key benefits of using components). On the other hand, if a component's instance is changed, the other instances as well as the original component will remain unaltered.
</SideNote>

### Preview

You have now created a simple mock-up for the start page of a digital-edition UI. By means of adding even more objects, groups, and components (to represent, for instance, images as well as further buttons and input fields), you can create visually realistic mock-ups of website pages. At this point, you might well wish to see your page in presentation mode (rather than work mode). For that, click the `Present` button (second button from right in the workspace tool bar). In the `Options` dropdown list, select `Fit to screen` to admire your "StartPage" in its entirety.

## Prototyping

What is more, Figma lets you also prototype interface functionality by simulating user interactivity and linking.

### An Easy Example: Create a Link to Another Page

Suppose that the "ImprintText" object on the bottom of your "StartPage" is meant to represent a link to another page containing information about the website's publisher. So, let's first build another page. Create a second desktop top-frame as you did above. It might be useful now to zoom out of the central window of the Figma workspace screen so that you can see both of your pages. Rename the new page to "ImprintPage". (While we are leaving that new page blank, you will usually want to design it in a way that is similar to your "StartPage". Among other things, you might well want to create a "NavBar" component and add it to the top of all of your pages.)

Turn the "ImprintText" object into a component as you did before with the logo placeholder (see instructions above in the "Create Components" section). This time, however, do not simply duplicate the component. Instead, drag-and-drop the "ImprintText" component from the "StartPage" frame into the gray area that surrounds it. That way, we can separate the orignal component, which we want to edit, from its instances. In the `Layers` area, the "ImprintText" component will no longer be shown within the "StartPage" hierarchy, but on the same level as both the "StartPage" and the "ImprintPage".

We can now create two different variants of our "ImprintText" component that correspond to two different types of user interaction:

1. "Default": when there is no user interaction,
2. "Hover": when a user's cursor hovers above the "ImprintText".

Keep the "ImprintText" component selected. In the right-hand `Design` area, click `Variants`. Our component has now automatically been duplicated. The lower twin of the component should be highlighted (if not, select it); in the `Variants` section, rename that variant (from "Variant2") to "Hover" to designate `Property 1`. When you highlight the upper variant of our component, its name should be "Default". Leave it like that.

<Figure src="images/howto_figma_08.png">
Figure 8: Renaming the second variant of your "ImprintText" component.
</Figure>

Now, we can design what it should look like when a cursor hovers over the "ImprintText". Twice double-click on the lower variant to highlight the text and style it bold. You could also change the text color, or add a drop shadow in the `Effects` segment.

The next step is to define the interaction that triggers that "Hover" variant. To that end, select the (upper) "Default" variant. In the top of the right-hand control area, switch from the `Design` to the `Prototype` tab. Next to `Interactions`, click the `+`. In the `Interaction details` window that now pops up, choose `While hovering` - `Change to` - "Hover". Close the window. As long as the `Prototype` tab is active, the "Default" variant is now visually connected to the "Hover" variant through a purple arrow, indicating that the former will change to the latter when an event (a hover event, in this case) takes place.

<Figure src="images/howto_figma_09.png">
Figure 9: Interaction details of the "ImprintText" component.
</Figure>

However, we also want the "ImprintText" component to link to the "ImprintPage" when clicked. For this, highlight the lower ("Hover") variant of the "ImprintText" component. In the `Prototype` section, click `+` and then select `On click` - `Navigate to` - "ImprintPage". A blue arrow will now visualize the linking to the "ImprintPage".

<Figure src="images/howto_figma_10.png">
Figure 10: Interaction as well as navigation details.
</Figure>

The "ImprintText" component is now fully configured, and an instance of it can be implemented in the design of the "StartPage". From the left-hand `Assets` area, beneath `Local components`, drag-and-drop the "ImprintText" component to the "ImprintFrame" of your "StartPage". Switch to `Present` mode and try out the hover event and linking.

### A More Complex Example: Create a Dropdown List

There is an empty dropdown button in your "NavBar" that we can now prototype as well. Proceed as before: create a component out of the "DropDown" group, and drag-and-drop it into the gray area outside your pages (leave more space around it than before). Create a "Hover" variant, which you can style by inverting its colors ("EditionBlue" text and border colors, "EditionWhite" fill color). Add an interaction that is triggered by a `Hover` event.

<Figure src="images/howto_figma_11.png">
Figure 11: Interaction details for two variants of your "DropDown" component.
</Figure>

We can now design three distinct states of the dropdown list to represent three different types of user interaction once a user's cursor hovers above the dropdown button:

1. "Click": when a user clicks on the button (the dropdown list opens, the button gets an "EditionBlue" fill color, the two options have an "EditionWhite" fill color),
2. "Hover1": when a user's cursor hovers over the first option of the open dropdown list (the button and the first option are blue, the second option is white),
3. "Hover2": when a user's cursor hovers over the second option (blue button and second option, white first option segment).

In the gray area of the central window, somewhere outside the purple dashed-line rectangle that marks the area of the "DropDown" component, design those three states. For this, you can copy-paste the "DropDownText" and "DropDownShape" objects from the "DropDown" component in the `Layers` area, and combine and style them to design the three states described above. All of these versions should have three segments: a button ("Drop-down") and two fields representing links to other pages (say, "Somewhere" and "Nowhere"). Group the objects that belong together and rename the groups "DropDownOpen", "DropDownOpenHover1", and "DropDownOpenHover2".

<Figure src="images/howto_figma_12.png">
Figure 12: Creating groups to represent the different states of an opened dropdown list.
</Figure>

Now, those groups that represent the three different states of the opened dropdown list can be used as different variants of the "DropDown" component. To do that, first select the "Hover" variant of the "DropDown" component and click on the purple `+` icon that will appear next to it; rename "Variant3" to "Click". Enlarge the purple dashed-line rectangle that delimits the component variants. In the left-hand `Layers` area, select and copy all objects of the "DropDownOpen" group.

<Figure src="images/howto_figma_13.png">
Figure 13: Copying the first group's objects ...
</Figure>

Further below in the `Layers` area, now, highlight the "Click" variant and paste the objects from the clipboard (use a keyboard shortcut to paste). The copied objects will now be shown in the `Layers` area as part of the "Click" variant. (You might also see here the "DropDownText" and "DropDownShape" of the original variant, which has been overwritten, being still around as part of the "Click" variant; you can delete them.)

<Figure src="images/howto_figma_14.png">
Figure 14: ... and pasting them into the "Click" variant.
</Figure>

In the `Prototype` area, create an interaction that links the "Hover" variant to the "Click" variant (`On click` - `Change to` - "Click").

Now, add two more variants, overwrite them with the two other groups designed below, and rename them "Hover1" and "Hover2", respectively. In the `Prototype` area, create the following user interactions:

- when a user clicks on the "Drop-down" button of the "Click" variant, change back to the "Default" variant (`On click` - `Change to` - "Default"),
- when a user's cursor hovers over the "Somewhere" field of the "Click" variant, change to the "Hover1" variant (`While hovering` - `Change to` - "Hover1"),
- when a user's cursor hovers over the "Nowhere" field of the "Click" variant, change to "Hover2" (`While hovering` - `Change to` - "Hover2").

<Figure src="images/howto_figma_15.png">
Figure 15: Interaction details for all five variants of your "DropDown" component.
</Figure>

Finally, create another page ("SomePage") and make Figma navigate to it when a user clicks on the "Somewhere" field of the "Hover1" variant (`On click`- `Navigate to` - "SomePage").

The "DropDown" component is now fairly well configured (fittingly, the "Nowhere" link links nowhere). From the `Assets` area, drag-and-drop it to the "NavBar" of your "StartPage". However, it is necessary to move that instance of our "DropDown" component, in the `Layers` area, from the "NavBar" sub-frame up to the "StartPage" top-frame (as its appearance will otherwise be limited to the slim space of the "NavBar" sub-frame).

<Figure src="images/howto_figma_16.png">
Figure 16: Inserting an instance of the "DropDown" component into your start page.
</Figure>

As long as the `Prototype` view is active, you will see a fairly complex network of interrelations between component variants (purple arrows) as well as links between variants and pages (blue arrows).

## Outlook

At this point, it may have become easy to see how a UI prototype can be further enriched by including more components whose variants, and the interrelations created between them, can add to realistically simulating website functionalities. It needs to be noted that there are many more functions than those introduced above, such as using the `Constraints` function to make your pages responsive, exporting CSS code from Figma, or Figma's build-in version control.

There is much community-driven support (both text and video) online that will help you to explore the full potentials of Figma and solve specific problems that you encounter. [Figma's Support Forum](https://forum.figma.com/) might be a good starting point for getting in touch with the user community. You will also find a large number of public plugins for standard functionalities (including dropdown menus).
