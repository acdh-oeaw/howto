This class comprises real persons who live or are assumed to have lived.

Legendary figures that may have existed, such as Ulysses and King Arthur, fall into this class if the documentation refers to them as historical figures. In cases where doubt exists as to whether several persons are in fact identical, multiple instances can be created and linked to indicate their relationship. The CIDOC CRM does not propose a specific form to support reasoning about possible identity.

In a bibliographic context, a name presented following the conventions usually employed for personal names will be assumed to correspond to an actual real person (an instance of E21 Person), unless evidence is available to indicate that this is not the case. The fact that a persona may erroneously be classified as an instance of E21 Person does not imply that the concept comprises personae.


Examples:
- Tut-Ankh-Amun (Edwards, 1979)
- Nelson Mandela (Brown, 2006)

This class comprises strings or codes assigned to instances of E1 CRM Entity in order to identify them uniquely and permanently within the context of one or more organisations. Such codes are often known as inventory numbers, registration codes, etc. and are typically composed of alphanumeric sequences. The class E42 Identifier is not normally used for machine-generated identifiers used for automated processing unless these are also used by human agents.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises concepts denoted by terms from thesauri and controlled vocabularies used to characterize and classify instances of CIDOC CRM classes. Instances of E55 Type represent concepts in contrast to instances of E41 Appellation which are used to name instances of CIDOC CRM classes.

E55 Type is the CIDOC CRM’s interface to domain specific ontologies and thesauri. These can be represented in the CIDOC CRM as subclasses of E55 Type, forming hierarchies of terms, i.e. instances of E55 Type linked via P127 has broader term (has narrower term): E55Type. Such hierarchies may be extended with additional properties.


Examples:
- weight, length, depth [types of E54]
- portrait, sketch, animation [types of E38]
- French, English, German [E56]
- excellent, good, poor [types of E3]
- Ford Model T, chop stick [types of E22]
- cave, doline, scratch [types of E26]
- poem, short story [types of E33]
- wedding, earthquake, skirmish [types of E5]

This class comprises the deaths of human beings.
If a person is killed, the death should be documented as an instance of both E69 Death and E7 Activity. The death or perishing of other living beings should be documented asinstances of E64 End of Existence.


Examples:
- the murder of Julius Caesar (E69,E7) (Irwin, 1935)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises signs, either meaningful or not, or arrangements of signs following a specific syntax, that are used or can be used to refer to and identify a specific instance of some class or category within a certain context.

Instances of E41 Appellation do not identify things by their meaning, even if they happen to have one, but instead by convention, tradition, or agreement. Instances of E41 Appellation are cultural constructs; as such, they have a context, a history, and a use in time and space by some group of users. A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e., other instances of E41 Appellation that are always regarded as equivalent independent from the thing it denotes.

Different languages may use different appellations for the same thing, such as the names of major cities. Some appellations may be formulated using a valid noun phrase of a particular language. In these cases, the respective instances of E41 Appellation should also be declared as instances of E33 Linguistic Object. Then the language using the appellation can be declared with the property P72 has language: E56 Language.

Instances of E41 Appellation may be used to identify any instance of E1 CRM Entity and sometimes are characteristic for instances of more specific subclasses E1 CRM Entity, such as for instances of E52 Time-Span (for instance "dates”), E39 Actor, E53 Place or E28 Conceptual Object. Postal addresses and E-mail addresses are characteristic examples of identifiers used by services transporting things between clients.

Even numerically expressed identifiers for extents in space or time are also regarded as instances of E41 Appellation, such as Gregorian dates or spatial coordinates, even though they allow for determining some time or location by a known procedure starting from a reference point and by virtue of that fact play a double role as instances of E59 Primitive Value.

E41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something. Cf. E15 Identifier Assignment


Examples:
- "Martin"
- "Aquae Sulis Minerva”
- "the Merchant of Venice" (E35)
- "Spigelia marilandica (L.) L." [not the species, just the name] (Hershberger, Jenkins and Robacker, 2015)
- "information science" [not the science itself, but the name through which we refer to it in an English-speaking context]
- "安” [Chinese "an", meaning "peace"]
- "6°5’29”N 45°12’13”W” (example of spatial coordinate)
- "Black queen’s bishop 4” [chess coordinate] (example of spatial coordinate)
- "19-MAR-1922” (example of date)
- "+41 22 418 5571” (example of contact point)
- "weasel@paveprime.com" (example of contact point)
- "CH-1211, Genève” (example of place appellation)
- "1-29-3 Otsuka, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 121, Japan” (example of address)
- "the poop deck of H.M.S Victory” (example of section definition)
- "the Venus de Milo’s left buttock” (example of section definition)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">
Scope note: This class comprises any gatherings or organizations of human individuals or groups that act collectively or in a similar way due to any form of unifying relationship. In the wider sense this class also comprises official positions which used to be regarded in certain contexts as one actor, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country. In such cases, it may happen that the group never had more than one member. A joint pseudonym (i.e., a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually used as a persona by two or more people) is a particular case of E74 Group. A gathering of people becomes an instance of E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together. These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modelled as membership in an instance of E74 Group (cf. HumanML markup). Married couples and other concepts of family are regarded as particular examples of E74 Group. Examples: - the impressionists (Wilson, 1983) - the Navajo (Correll, 1972) - the Greeks (Williams, 1993) - the peace protestors in New York City on February 15 2003 - Exxon-Mobil (‘Exxon Mobil Corp’, Mergent's dividend achievers, vol. 3, no. 3, 2006, pp. 97-97) - King Solomon and his wives (Thieberger, 1947) - The President of the Swiss Confederation - Nicolas Bourbaki (Aczel, 2007) - Betty Crocker (Crocker, 2012) - Ellery Queen (Wheat, 2005) - Greenpeace - Paveprime Ltd - the National Museum of Denmark In First Order Logic: E74(x) ⊃ E39(x)

This property describes the naming or identification of any real world item by a name or any other identifier.

This property is intended for identifiers in general use, which form part of the world the model intends to describe, and not merely for internal database identifiers which are specific to a technical system, unless these latter also have a more general use outside the technical context. This property includes in particular identification by mathematical expressions such as coordinate systems used for the identification of instances of E53 Place. The property does not reveal anything about when, where and by whom this identifier was used. A more detailed representation can be made using the fully developed (i.e. indirect) path through E15 Identifier Assignment.

P1 is identified by (identifies), is a shortcut for the path from ‘E1 CRM Entity’ through ‘P140i was attributed by’, ‘E15 Identifier Assignment’, ‘P37 assigned’,‘E42 Identifier’.


Examples:
- the capital of Italy (E53) is identified by "Rome" (E48)

This property allows sub typing of CIDOC CRM entities - a form of specialisation – through the use of a terminological hierarchy, or thesaurus.
The CIDOC CRM is intended to focus on the high-level entities and relationships needed to describe data structures. Consequently, it does not specialise entities any further than is required for this immediate purpose. However, entities in the isA hierarchy of the CIDOC CRM may by specialised into any number of sub entities, which can be defined in the E55 Type hierarchy. E41 Appellation, for example, may be specialised into "e-mail address”, "telephone number”, "post office box”, "URL” etc. none of which figures explicitly in the CIDOC CRM hierarchy. A comprehensive explanation about refining CIDOC CRM concepts by E55 Type is given in the section "About Types” in the section on "Specific Modelling Constructs” of this document.
In ViecPro E55 is used to assign a gender category to a person.

- "enquiries@cidoc-crm.org" (E51) has type e-mail address (E55)

This property in APIS gives the opportunity to add data about kind of membership in a group and connect it with a joining event. This property identifies the instance of E74 Group of which an instance of E39 Actor becomes a member through an instance of E85 Joining. Although a Joining activity normally concerns only one instance of E74 Group, it is possible to imagine circumstances under which becoming member of one Group implies becoming member of another Group as well. Joining events allow for describing people becoming members of a group with a more detailed path from E74 Group through, P144i gained member by, E85 Joining, P143 joined , E39 Actor, compared to the shortcut offered by P107 has current or former member (is current or former member of). The property P144.1 kind of memIber can be used to specify the type of membership or the role the member has in the group. Examples: - The election of Sir Isaac Newton as Member of Parliament to the Convention Parliament of 1689 (E85) joined with the Convention Parliament (E74) - The inauguration of Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev as Leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1985 (E85) joined with the office of Leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) (E74) with P144.1 kind of member President (E55) - The implementation of the membership treaty January 1. 1973 between EU and Denmark (E85) joined with EU (E74) In First Order Logic: P144(x,y) ⊃ E85(x) P144(x,y)⊃ E74(y) P144(x,y,z) ⊃ [P144(x,y) ∧ E55(z)] P144(x,y) ⊃ P11(x,y)

Scope note: This property associates an instance of E2 Temporal Entity with the instance of E52 Time-Span during which it was on-going. The associated instance of E52 Time-Span is understood as the real time-span during which the phenomena making up the temporal entity instance were active. More than one instance of E52 Temporal Entity may share a common instance of E52 Time-Span only if they come into being and end being due to an identical declarations or events. Examples: - the Yalta Conference (E7) has time-span Yalta Conference time-span (E52) In First Order Logic: P4(x,y) ⊃ E2(x) P4(x,y) ⊃ E52(y)

    Property P82 described the narrowest known outer bounds of the temporal extent of an E52 Time-Span, i.e. that the described temporal phenomenon is definitely ongoing "at some time within” this interval.
