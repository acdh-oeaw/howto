## Version control and tracking changes

Git's main purpose is to track changes in your projects, either for yourself or to keep a team updated. It works best when used with plaintext file formats such as source code, XML/TEI documents or Markdown content. While Git will happily store _images_, _audio files_, or `.doc` and `.pdf` documents. However, it was not designed to help you with changes in those kinds of documents and cannot its full diffing/merging capacities with them. 

Git
-  solves the problem of keeping versions of text documents in sync among sometimes thousands of collaborators working on a software product.
- It helps integrate changes by multiple collaborators and also solve situations where two people edit the same part of a document.



Let’s look at how change tracking with Git works in practice, in a local project on your computer (no network connection required). We’ll walk through how to work with Git in the terminal, because that is where Git was originally meant to be used, and because it helps to understand what is actually going on. This involves learning a handful of Git commands, and while that might seem intimidating at first, you’ll see that it becomes second-nature with a bit of practice very quickly. 

However, if you prefer to work with Git via a **graphical user interface (GUI)**, take a look at the bonus section at the end of this introduction, which lists some popular editor or operating system integrations.

<SideNote type="note">
The commands you learn for working in a local project also apply for working collaboratively. Working in the terminal helps to understand what is going on behind the scenes.
