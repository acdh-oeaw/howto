## Using Git for collaborative team work

In this section we'll look at using Git to manage files in a project that is being worked on by more
than one person as this is the most likely reason why you might be asked to use Git.

This involves synchronizing changes across computer networks, and resolving conflicts between document versions that can arise when two people have changed the same document in different ways.

Many **"drive" services in the cloud** like https://ucloud.univie.ac.at, https://www.dropbox.com,
https://onedrive.live.com/ or https://drive.google.com" provide
such mechanisms in their Web interface as well. Git however is often more fine grained and stricter.

It is often easier for programs to interact with Git services then with "drive" services. That's why
software developers often ask you to use Git instead of any "drive" service.

If you get into the Git workflow you may want to use it also locally for any kind of documents
(remember Git is best at text documents, but not limited to them).

Most imporantly however, everything we have learned in the first part is still valid: in Git everybody always works on a local copy of a project, and Git helps to keep local project copies in sync. This is why Git is sometimes called a distributed version control system.

## Remote repositories

Working with remote repositories can tell git that multiple people are working on the same documents, keep track of changing documents and synchronise changes. Depending on the nature of you project, you might need to set up a remote repository or clone an already existing remote repository. In the following, we will take a closer look at both options.

### Creating a remote repository

When collaborators work on their shared project on their own computers, - how can they tell Git about their respective local project copies? By configuring a so-called “remote repository” which points to the URL of that copy:

```bash
git remote add my-colleagues-version-of-the-project htts://example.com/our-project.git
```

Now, while this could work in principle, it would require a bit of server configuration on your part, and it would get pretty complicated very quickly with teams of more than two members. This is why we will usually use a Git hosting provider like GitHub or GitLab to store a primary copy of our project, with which all team members can synchronize their local project copies. These Git hosting providers take care of all the complicated server-side stuff involved.

<SideNote type="info" title="Git hosting providers">
There are various git hosting providers out there, some of the most prominent ones being GitHub and GitLab.

We are going to use **GitHub** in this section, but other services like GitLab work very similarly. Although **GitHub** has a nice **browser-based graphical user interface at [https://github.com](**https://github.com**)**, and also provides a **Desktop client** for all operating systems, we are going to keep using the terminal to communicate with GitHub first.

If you want to follow along, please download and install the GitHub CLI and **create a GitHub user** account if you don’t have one already.

CLI INSTRUCTION!
</SideNote>

First, let’s create a new empty remote repository called my-test-project on GitHub’s servers:

```bash
gh repo create my-test-project
```

To connect a local Git project with the newly created remote repository, type:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/my-git-username/my-test-project
```

By convention, the remote repository which holds the primary copy of a project is called “origin”.

### Cloning a remote repository

In many research projects, setting up a remote repository will be one of the initial steps, so there is no need to connect a pre-existing local project with a remote repository which simplifies things a lot. Instead we can **clone** a remote repository, which will take care of initialising the project locally, connecting it with the remote, and synchronising the local project with the current state of the remote.

To **clone** a local repository from a remote repository, we can copy it's URL and create a local copy on our machine in a directory of our choosing, using the command `git clone <url>`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/my-git-username/my-test-project
```

The above will create a local directory for the git repository that has the same name as the remote repo, "my-test-project". If you would like to change the local directory's name to something else, you can do so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/my-git-username/my-test-project the_new_project
```

Now, our local git repo sits in a directory called "the_new_project".

Alternatively to the `https://`protocol, you can also use the SSH transfer protocol. Check the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) for further information.

### Keeping repositories in sync: fetch, pull, push

Working collaboratively also means keeping in sync with changes that have been created as well as bringing your own work back into the remote repository. 

These three commands are essential to keep your local version in sync with the remote repository:

```bash
git fetch
```

`git fetch` fetches any changes that have been made to the remote repository while you were working on your own local repository. The command will show changes that are not in your local version yet.They need to be integrated before you can push your version back into the remote repository. You can specify which branch you want to fetch by adding its name. Using `git log` in the terminal will give you further information on the changes. Use `git commit` and `git merge` to integrate the changes.

```bash
git pull
```

`git pull` is similar to `git fetch`. However, when you use this command, the change in the remote repository or remote branch are merged into your local copy straight away. While `git fetch` gives you more control, `git pull` is faster when you want to perform multiple actions.

```bash
git push
```

`git push` is the opposite action of `git fetch`and `git pull`. You _push back_ your local branch or repository into the remote repository. If you have already an upstream remote for your local branch, `git push` can push to that branch as a default. In case you don't want to use the default branch, you can specify the branch every time you push: `git push <remote> <branch-name>`.

<SideNote type="tip" title="Good practice when collaborating">
When you collaborate with others, it is considered good practice to `git pull` before you `git push` to the remote. This way, you can resolve conflicts locally and avoid conflicts in the remote. These so-called *merge conflicts* are sometimes difficult to entangle, so take your time when pushing your work. Code editors clearly visualise conflicts and help you with a clean work flow.
