### Learning outcomes
- work collaboratively with git

## Using Git for collaborative team work

In this section we'll look at using Git to manage files in a project that is being worked on by more
than one person as this is the most likely reason why you might be asked to use Git.

This involves synchronizing changes across computer networks, and resolving conflicts between document versions that can arise when two people have changed the same document in different ways.

Many **"drive" services in the cloud** like https://ucloud.univie.ac.at, https://www.dropbox.com,
https://onedrive.live.com/ or https://drive.google.com" provide
such mechanisms in their Web interface as well. Git however is often more fine grained and stricter.

It is often easier for programs to interact with Git services then with "drive" services. That's why
software developers often ask you to use Git instead of any "drive" service.

If you get into the Git workflow you may want to use it also locally for any kind of documents
(remember Git is best at text documents, but not limited to them).

If you have not done so we recommend you read the [paragraph on Git terminology](terminology#official-git-terminology-working-area-staging-area-repository) in the terminology text.
