The selected texts and annotation exercises will accompany you through the curriculum and will be used to exemplify some possibilities of how to use the TEI Guidelines.

For the annotation exercises, pages 11 and 12 of the Viennese film magazine _Die Filmwelt, Nr. 31, publication year 1924_, will be used. The selected pages comprises a short film review including a cinema programme, a poem, several short entries under the caption "Film-Kritiken" (film reviews) and an announcement by the magazine's editorial staff. The magazine is available online at [Ã–NB-ANNO](http://anno.onb.ac.at/) ([Filmwelt 31, 1924, Page 11](http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/annoshow-plus?call=fwt|1924|0131|00000011||jpg||45|), [Filmwelt 31, 1924, Page 12](http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/annoshow-plus?call=fwt|1924|0131|00000012||jpg||45|)).

With this sample text, a number of aspects of text annotations will be exemplified. Next to different text types, different structures such as headings, paragraphs, verse lines, headers and footers, as well as a list are present. Furthermore, line breaks and paginations, bold type and letter spacing, dates, names of people and places, an illustration, and even a typographical error can be found. All these components and textual properties will be converted with the help of TEI from an analogue to a digital format, which offers many possibilities for usage and opens new perspectives on the texts.

An important tool for working with the vocabulary of the _TEI Guidelines_ is their detailed documentation with its numerous examples. To facilitate your work at the beginning, the following chapters regularly contain links to the respective chapters of the TEI modules.

Tip: Open the [Guidelines](https://tei-c.org/guidelines/P5/) during your work. There, you will find links to lists with [elements](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/REF-ELEMENTS.html) and [attributes](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/REF-ATTS.html), or you can directly [search](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html) for individual components.

The aim of the curriculum is to introduce you to the basics of TEI annotation and thus enable you to complete the tasks prepared here without difficulties.
