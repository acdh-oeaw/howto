  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Windows">
      You can paste the `https://...` of any git repository from a server in the text field that appears
      when we click `Clone Git repository...` on the start screen of VSCodium or Visual Studio Code
      ![clone workshop](/assets/images/clone_workshop.png "clone workshop")
      After you hit enter a dialog appears asking you where to store the contents of the repository
      locally:
      ![select repository location Windows](/assets/images/select_repository_location_Windows.png "select repository location Windows")
      The very first time for each web site like gitlab.oeaw.ac.at in Windows a dialog will open that asks
      us for user name and password.
      ![credentials dialog Windows](/assets/images/credentials_dialog_Windows.png "credentials dialog Windows")
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="MacOS">
      You can paste the `https://...` of any git repository from a server in the text field that appears
      when we click `Clone Git repository...` on the start screen of VSCodium or Visual Studio Code
      ![clone workshop](/assets/images/clone_workshop.png "clone workshop")
      On MacOS Visual Studio Code asks us for our username and password when we try to clone the
      repository the first time.
      ![username password MacOS](/assets/images/username_password_MacOS.png "username password MacOS")
      These are passed to Git and Git saves them in the "keychain" which also for example Safari
      uses to save credentials.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Linux">
      On Linux Visual Studio Code asks us for our username and password when we try to clone the
      repository the first time.

      If git-credential-libsecret is installed the username and password will be stored and Visual
      Studio Code will not ask us in the future. If it is not installed we have to type the password
      again next time we interact with the repository on the gilab server.
