In this resource, you will learn

- track changes in VS Code
- clone and push a remote repository

## Starting our editor with add-ons: Visual Studio Code

### Windows

Open (Visual Studio) Code or VS(Codium) from the start menu. You can just open it and start typing Code or VS.

### Linux

Open the start menu or the application drawer of your desktop environment and search for Code or VSCodium.

## Cloning a remote repository

Follow the steps that are explained in getting an access token, so that you can link your editor to your Git account.

Getting access to the data on gitlab.oeaw.ac.at is different on all three OS

#### Windows

You can paste the \`https://...\` of any git repository from a server in the text field that appears when we click \`Clone Git repository...\` on the start screen of VSCodium or Visual Studio Code.

After you hit enter a dialog appears asking you where to store the contents of the repository locally:

![](images/select_repository_location_windows.png "select repository location Windows")

  !\[select repository location Windows](/assets/images/select_repository_location_Windows.png "select repository location Windows")
  The very first time for each web site like gitlab.oeaw.ac.at in Windows a dialog will open that asks
  us for user name and password.

#### MacOS

You can paste the \`https://...\` of any git repository from a server in the text field that appears when we click \`Clone Git repository...\` on the start screen of VSCodium or Visual Studio Code:

![](images/vscode_getting_started_macos.png)

```
  On MacOS Visual Studio Code asks us for our username and password when we try to clone the
  repository the first time.
  !\[username password MacOS](/assets/images/username_password_MacOS.png "username password MacOS")
  These are passed to Git and Git saves them in the "keychain" which also for example Safari
  uses to save credentials.
```

#### Linux

```
  On Linux Visual Studio Code asks us for our username and password when we try to clone the
  repository the first time.
```

<SideNote type="info">


```
  If git-credential-libsecret is installed the username and password will be stored and Visual
  Studio Code will not ask us in the future. If it is not installed we have to type the password
  again next time we interact with the repository on the gilab server.
