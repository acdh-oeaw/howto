abstract: The goal of this course is to introduce students to the important role
  played by dictionary usage research when developing and implementing new
  dictionaries. The course will address the question of how different types of
  target users (in terms of age, language proficiency and pre-existing skills)
  or different types of use (encoding, decoding, translation etc.) influence the
  scope of the dictionary, the lemma selection process or the very structure of
  a dictionary entry. At the end of this course, students will have a
  fundamental understanding of the ways in which user research (both
  commercially and academically) can contribute to the tailoring of
  lexicographic content. Going beyond the realm of user-centered lexicography,
  the course will also explore possible user contributions in the creation of
  content and the increasing importance of crowdsourcing in lexicography.

# Summary:

The goal of this course is to introduce students to the important role played by dictionary usage research when developing and implementing new dictionaries. The course will address the question of how different types of target users (in terms of age, language proficiency and pre-existing skills) or different types of use (encoding, decoding, translation etc.) influence the scope of the dictionary, the lemma selection process or the very structure of a dictionary entry. At the end of this course, students will have a fundamental understanding of the ways in which user research (both commercially and academically) can contribute to the tailoring of lexicographic content. Going beyond the realm of user-centered lexicography, the course will also explore possible user contributions in the creation of content and the increasing importance of crowdsourcing in lexicography.

# Learning outcomes:

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- understand the role of users in dictionary-making process
- distinguish between different types of users, as well as understand some of the specifics of different user groups
- know different methods for conducting user research, including advantages of shortcomings of each of the method
- understand the concept of crowdsourcing and different techniques of using the method in dictionary compilation.

## Dictionary users and their role in making a dictionary

When starting to plan a compilation of a dictionary, one always has to consider its users. As Atkins and Rundell point out (2008: 32), in order to meet the needs of (most) users, one needs "to get the clearest possible picture of who these users are and what kinds of question they will ask of their dictionary". One of the first and most important tasks of dictionary editors and lexicographers is to prepare a profile of their user(s), and read up on the latest literature on dictionary use. In this course, we will look at different types of users, different methods used for conducting dictionary use research, and some recent developments on including users into dictionary-making process.

## Different types of dictionary users

There are various types of dictionary users, differing in age, education, language proficiency, contexts in which they will use a dictionary, and so forth. While a dictionary may attempt to target several different types of users, one group should be selected as the main target group. This will then have an effect on dictionary macrostructure and microstructure, for example on the amount of information provided (e.g. number of headwords), wording of the definitions and even data presentation (which features will be given more prominence).

## Example scenario

### Type of dictionary: General Bilingual Dictionary

There are many criteria that can be used to classify dictionaries. If we use form as a criteria, we can distinguish between monolingual, covering only one language, bilingual, covering two languages and multilingual, covering more than two languages. Many bilingual dictionaries are bidirectional which means they actually contain two dictionaries in one; of the two languages involved, one is once a source language and once a target language. Let us assume we are planning a general bilingual dictionary for Italian - German/ German-Italian.

### Expected users:

One of the main users groups of this dictionary are translators, as one of the purposes of the dictionary is assisting in translation tasks (this is also mentioned on the dictionary cover). Translators as a user group is a heterogeneous group and can be divided into two sub-user groups: translation students and professional translators.

**Translation students:** They have linguistic and cultural transfer skills in at least two working languages, in this case German and Italian. These skills include lexical, grammatical and pragmatic knowledge of both languages. One of the languages might their native language, or they have near-native competence of at least one of the two languages. However, translation students still have to improve their linguistic and cultural transfer skills and they have to acquire domain competences, i.e. knowledge in domain specific fields and domain-specific language. Translation students are expected to possess relevant dictionary skills such as how to consult dictionaries and search for external resources (e.g. corpora, encyclopedia etc.).

**Professional translators:** They have high language and cultural skills in at least two working languages. One of the languages might be their native language, or they have near-native competence of at least one of the working languages, in this case German and Italian. They have domain competences, i.e. knowledge in domain specific fields and domain specific language, or at least they are aware that additional knowledge is needed from external sources. Professional translators have high dictionary use skills.

Another potential user group are **language learners**.

**Learners of German:** Language learners of German (as L2) might be high school students or university students with Italian as their native language.

**Learners of Italian:** Language learners of Italian (as L1) might be high school students or university students with German as their native language.

**What the users will use the dictionary for:**

Translation students will use the dictionary to:

- understand the source text
- find equivalents in the target language
- find contextual information
- translate from L1 to L2
- translate from L2 to L1
