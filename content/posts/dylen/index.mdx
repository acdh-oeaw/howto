#### 1. Introduction

Do you want to investigate the development of words in Austria in the course of time? 

Then let me introduce to [DYLEN](https://dylen-tool.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/), an interactive visualization tool created by the Diachronic Dynamics of Lexical Networks project to provide insights into the dynamic lexical changes of Austrian German during the last 20 years

The tool consists of 

data from 2 corpora:

- Austrian Media Corpus (AMC)
- Corpus of Austrian Parliamentary Records (parlAT) 

3 network types:

- Ego Network
- General Network (Party) 
- General Network (Speaker)

and 2 additional components:

- Node Metrics Comparison
- Time Series Analysis.

I will guide you through on how to use the tool.
