## 1. Introduction

Do you want to investigate the development of words in Austria in the course of time? 

Then let me introduce to [DYLEN](https://dylen-tool.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/), an interactive visualization tool created by the Diachronic Dynamics of Lexical Networks project to provide insights into the dynamic lexical changes of Austrian German during the last 20 years.

The tool consists of data from 2 corpora:

- Austrian Media Corpus (AMC),
- Corpus of Austrian Parliamentary Records (parlAT), 

3 network types:

- Ego Network,
- General Network (Party), 
- General Network (Speaker),

and 2 additional components:

- Node Metrics Comparison,
- Time Series Analysis.

I will now guide you through on how to use the tool.

## 2. Networks

### 2﻿.1. Ego Network

The Ego Network visualizes the **50** most closely related **semantic neighbours** of a **target word**.

On the input field on the left side bar

1. select a corpus (i.e., AMC or PARLAT), 
2. select a subcorpus (e.g., a specific newspaper),
3. type a target word (e.g., 'Geld'),
4. and finally click _Visualize_.

   - select a metric, 
   - adjust the percentage of nodes to be displayed,
4. and finally click _Visualize_.
