## Introduction

[DYLEN](https://dylen-tool.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/) is the acronym of the **Diachronic Dynamics of Lexical Networks.** It is an interactive visualization tool that the Diachronic Dynamics of Lexical Networks project team created to provide insights into the dynamic lexical changes of Austrian German during the last 20 years. It helps lexicographers and linguists to analyse the development of Austrian German lexemes over the course of time. It is an open source tool that can be used free of charge.

[DYLEN](https://dylen-tool.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/) enables lexical network research on large-scale authentic language data that are taken from two Austrian Geman corpora, the [Austria Media Corpus (amc)](https://amc.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/) and [Corpus of Austrian Parliamentary Records (ParlAT)](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/tools/parlat). 

Dylen provides three options:

- Ego Network,
- General Network (Party), 
- General Network (Speaker),

and 2 additional components:

- Node Metrics Comparison,
- Time Series Analysis.

<SideNote type="info" title="amc and ParlAT">
Both corpora provide large-scale language data on Austrian German from the last 20 years.

The amc is one of the largest German language corpora and reflects the Austrian media landscape almost in its entirety (newspapers, magazines, press releases and some news reel transcripts). It contains about 12 billion tokens and is updated every year. It reflects the Austrian media landscape  You can register for access for linguistic analysis [here](https://amc.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/) and learn more about it in this HowTo.

The [ParlAT corpus](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/tools/parlat) comprises the Austrian parliamentary records and contains around 75 million tokens. This corpus is expanded over time, too. It is also part of the CLARIN [ParlaMINT project](https://www.clarin.eu/parlamint).

## Networks

Diachronic networks derive from the texts in amc and ParlAT with the help of word embeddings. In NLP, word embeddings are representations of words. 

The user interface is very intuitive but every search starts with deciding on either an **ego network** or a **general network** (**party** or **speaker**). The first step on your diachronic network journey is to select the network that you would like to generate.

### Ego Network

Connected words are **semantic neighbours** that share some aspects of the **target word**. Some can even substitute the target word in a particular context. The Ego Network visualizes the **50** most closely related semantic neighbours of a target word. Note that it does not show the target word itself because it would render the visualisation impossible to read. The semantic neighbours are classified as parts of speech (POS), e.g. noun, proper nouns and verbs.

#### Instructions:

![](images/picture2.png "Input field for Ego Network")

On the input field on the left side bar, you can

1. select a corpus (i.e., AMC or PARLAT), 
2. select a subcorpus (e.g., a specific newspaper),
3. type a target word (e.g., 'Geld'),
4. and finally click _Visualize_.

#### Understanding the visualisation

Once you clicked on visualize, Dylen will generate your network. Let's stick with our "Geld" (money) example.

![The egonetwork for "Geld": differently sized nodes connected by lines, a timeline on the top and parts of speech in different colours](images/egonetwork_geld_nodedetail.png "The ego network for \\\"Geld\\\" (money)")

Above, you see the semantic neighbours represented by nodes that can be dragged further apart to get a better overview. Their size indicates their frequency. The bigger the node, the more commonly it is used in the corpus. You can click on each node to highlight the connections. The colours represent different parts of speech and you can change them to your preference.

#### Metrics

![a bar with five sliders](images/parallelcoordinatesoptions.png "Parallel coordinates options: normalised frequency, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, pagerank, clustering coefficient")

In addition, you can select the metrics for the parallel coordinates with the sliders. These metrics are presented in the parallel coordinates plot. Every graph line represents one word and each vertical axis stands for the value in the respective metric. You can visualise all or selected words in the node metrics comparison. When you click the lines, you can inspect the values for each metric.

![four lines cut by five axes for the words verurteilen, Strafe, Haft and Gefängnis](images/node-metric-comparison_geldstrafe.png "Lines and fives axes for the words verurteilen, Strafe, Haft, Gefängnis when analysing an ego network for \\\"Geldstrafe\\\" in 1996.")

### General Networks

General networks reflect the speeches of a particular politician or a political party. Those networks are larger than ego networks and require more filters that make the visualisation more legible. Under General Networks you can explore **frequent lexemes** used by particular political parties **(General Network Party)** or individual politicians **(General Network Speaker)** in the Austrian Parliament. 

#### I﻿nstructions:

![The selection tab for general networks. The result will display 20% of the word with lowest degree centrality for Werner Amon from the ÖVP](images/picture3.png "Input field of General Network (Speaker) for Werner Amon from the ÖVP")

On the input field on the left side bar, you can

1. select a party, 
2. select a speaker (only for General Network Speaker),
3. (optional, but recommended) use the _Node filter_ to 

   - select a metric (e.g. Degree Centrality) 
   - adjust the percentage of nodes to be displayed,
4. and finally click _Visualize_.
