name: TEI
description: The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a consortium which
  collectively develops and maintains a standard for the representation of texts
  in digital form. Its chief deliverable is a set of Guidelines which specify
  encoding methods for machine-readable texts, chiefly in the humanities, social
  sciences and linguistics. Since 1994, the TEI Guidelines have been widely used
  by libraries, museums, publishers, and individual scholars to present texts
  for online research, teaching, and preservation.
