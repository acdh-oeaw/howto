name: Controlled vocabulary
description: A controlled vocabulary is used to organise knowledge and make this
  knowledge available for retrieval. The scheme designers define the specific
  terminology that must be used to organise and index this knowledge. The
  biggest advantage of a controlled vocabulary is that it defines a clear
  terminology which is consistently used, therefore knowledge is more easily
  searchable and findable. Famous examples are the Dublin Core and the Library
  of Congress Subject Headings.
