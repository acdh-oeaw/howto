name: ontology
description: An ontology represents entities, data and ideas through the
  definition of categories, their properties, their interdependencies and
  relations, that show how the concepts, data and entities are related to a
  particular subject area, i.e. discourse. An ontology limits the complexity of
  a subject area and groups data into information and knowledge. When a
  controlled vocabulary is used to talk about the information and knowledge that
  are represented in an ontology, communication issues between experts are
  minimised.
