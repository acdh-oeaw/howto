name: Linked Open Data
description: Linked Open Data, LOD for short, is a term coined by Tim
  Berners-Lee in 2006. He said that "Linked Open Data (LOD) is Linked Data which
  is released under an open license, which does not impede its reuse for free."
  Linked Data is structured data that is interlinked with other data. You can
  apply semantic queries to this data. Standard web technologies like HTTP, RDF
  and URIs are used to share information that can be read by computers, and the
  internet becomes a global database. Examples for LOD are DBpedia, Wikidata and
  Geonames.
