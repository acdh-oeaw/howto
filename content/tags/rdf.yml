name: RDF
description: RDF, the Resource Description Framework, is based on the idea that
  statements about resources are expressed as so-called triples,
  subject-predicate-object, a form of knowledge representation. The subject
  denotes the resource, and the predicate denotes traits or aspects of the
  resource, and expresses a relationship between the subject and the object. RDF
  is an abstract model, but it has several specialised file formats. The
  encoding for triples can vary, depending on the format.
